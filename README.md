# Decision Tree Mini Tool

## Overview

This is a function implementing a classification decision tree learning method to the training data. The resulting decision boundaries are plotted as a result.

(Note) This function requires python 3.6 or higher. This tool is released with the required dependencies found in the venv folder.

## How to Use
# Exhaustive Feature Pairing

In the exhaustive pairing mode, the function will build a tree for each possible pairings of features/attributes found in your training data. Let us run through an example:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
```

# Selective Feature Pairing
